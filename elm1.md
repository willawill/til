### basic language spec

- `+` is for number only, `++` is for concat strings

- `/` is for float number, `//` is for integer

- elm doesn't have truthiness. Where the numbers and strings and lists can be used as boolean value

- it follows the identation rule from python

- List is like array in other language, but elements in a List must have the same type

-  Elm does not have a concept of “methods” where your data and logic are tightly coupled. 

- Elm has modules

- Tuples can hold a fixed number of items, they can have different types, it's like hash in ruby, but since elm is strong typed
it's gonna be something similar to { :a => "b", :b => "c" }
