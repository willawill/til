t's common to use this approach -- it can be argued that it's conceptually nicer to keep what you are requesting somewhat separate from the details of your credentials for making the request. The "Authorization" HTTP header is a standard one to use for credentials (e.g. HTTP Basic Auth http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side, AWS API http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html#ConstructingTheAuthenticationHeader and many more).

It also removes the possibility of clashes between your credential parameters and other parameters. For a trivial example, imagine you use password for your credential password and also want a normal parameter called password for a particular API call (when you're updating another user perhaps). You can't have that - one of them has to be named differently. Ok, you can easily do that, but it's a little artificial, and if you instead supply the password for the credentials in the Authorization header, you are free to have a parameter called password which relates to the actual request you are making (e.g. the new password you're setting for some other user).
